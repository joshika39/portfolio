# Resume

I'm Joshua (joshika39), a software engineer based in Budapest. I enjoy working across a broad spectrum of technologies — from desktop and web development to IoT, the Apple ecosystem, and game engines like Unity, Unreal, and Godot.

I’m also passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge. I regularly write articles and contribute to open source projects to help others grow in their programming journey. You’ll find a few highlighted projects below, and even more  
on my [GitHub](https://github.com/joshika39) profile.
